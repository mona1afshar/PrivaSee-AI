# PrivaSee-AI

We built PrivaSee AI, a tool that will help social media users feel safe when posting images and videos online. PrivaSee scans the background of images and videos and points out potential private information leaks such as room/house numbers, computer/phone screens and logos. With this tool, social media users can ensure they are not leaking any information that could potentially put their safety in danger. 

Our team was able to secure 2nd place overall at SheHacks+, win the MLH prize for best domain name and even got an honourable mention from GM!
